## About Me

I’m a data-driven Product Manager with 4 years’ experience in product and project management. I’m passionate about technology, philosophy and the intersection of the two - how great technology and design can change the way we live and change our understanding of the most basic concepts of human knowledge.

In 2013, I completed a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Warwick. My research focussed on the question of whether our mental states (what we think) can really be said to cause things in the physical world, or whether all causation is ultimately reducible to physical causation (e.g. neurons firing, molecules moving, etc.). I argued within a physicalist framework ([physicalism] (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/) is the view that everything that exists either _is_ physical or is grounded in the physical), but argued that on the most plausible definition of causation, our mental states really do cause things and that we lose something central to causation when we try to reduce everything to physical causation. You can check out my PhD thesis [here] (https://philpapers.org/profile/68161). 

I now apply my philosophy skills to the tech/product management world – scrutinizing user problems, using data to form my hypotheses, challennging assumptions, conducting research to scope new opportunities, designing valid experiments, making strong arguments, but crucially taking other opinions and arguments on board to find the best solutions for users. 

I have 4 years’ experience in the product and project management world. I’ve led on new product development, managing portfolios of existing products, retiring legacy products, API builds, microsites, fundraising innovation products, working with agencies, and lots more.
