## About Me

I’m a data-driven Product Manager with a passion for technology and products that can improve the way we live. I have exceptional communication and analytical skills, with a background in research and a PhD in Philosophy. I’m a Certified Scrum Product Owner and Certified Lean Kanban practitioner. 

In 2013, I completed a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Warwick. I now apply my philosophy skills to the tech/product management world – scrutinizing user problems, using data to form hypotheses, challenging assumptions, conducting research to scope new business opportunities, designing valid experiments, making strong arguments, but taking other opinions and arguments on board to find the best solutions for users and the business. 

I have five years’ experience in the product and project management world. I’ve led on new product development, managed portfolios of existing products, retired legacy products, worked on API builds, microsites, payment gateway implementation and lots more.

## Research

Y. Bassi. **Interventionism and the Exclusion Problem** Department of Philosophy, University of Warwick, 2013.
Supervisor: [Christoph Hoerl](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/hoerl/). [Download here](https://philpapers.org/profile/68161). 

My research focussed on the question of whether our mental states (what we think) are causally efficacious, or whether all causation is ultimately reducible to physical causation (e.g. neurons firing, molecules moving, etc.). I argued within a physicalist framework ([physicalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/) is the view that everything that exists either _is_ physical or is grounded in the physical), but argued that on the most plausible definition of causation, our mental states really do cause things and that we lose something central to causation when we try to reduce everything to physical causation. 

## More about me 
I practice yoga and mindfulness and completed a British Wheel of Yoga Foundation course in 2013. I’m a committee member of a sight loss charity called [RP Fighting Blindness](https://www.rpfightingblindness.org.uk/home.php?home=yes) and am also a qualified English Language teacher. I spent five and half year’s working at a call centre whilst at University, where I learnt the underrated art of great customer service. I love all things science fiction.
