## About Me

I’m a Product Manager and Product Leader with a passion for technology that can improve the way we live. I have a background in research and a PhD in Philosophy. I’m a Certified Scrum Product Owner and Certified Lean Kanban practitioner. I'm currently the Head of Product at [eve sleep](https://www.evesleep.co.uk/).  

As a product leader, I design and deliver the strategies and technical capabilities that businesses need to meet their goals. I have an open and collaborative ethos and build strong relationships of trust in the teams and businesses I work in. This allows me to deliver results in a range of environments from challenging to super open and collaborative and ultimately get the best results for the user and the business. 

My product experience spans the commercial sector, charity sector and agency side. I've worked both as a technical product manager - leading major replatform projects, payment gateway implementations, CMS replatform and lots more and as a user focussed Product Manager - establishing a user testing programme, facilitating user testing, using data and analytics to form hypotheses, running web experiments and analysing results, running design sprints and loads more. I've led teams of product managers, designers, QA testers and developers.    

In 2013, I completed a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Warwick. I now apply these skills to the tech & product management world – understanding and solving complex problems, using data to form hypotheses, designing valid experiments and conducting research to scope new opportunities for the product and the business, challenging assumptions and building strong arguments, whilst being open to other opinions and arguments.

## Research

Y. Bassi. **Interventionism and the Exclusion Problem** Department of Philosophy, University of Warwick, 2013.
Supervisor: [Christoph Hoerl](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/hoerl/). [Download here](https://philpapers.org/profile/68161). 

My research focussed on the question of whether our mental states (what we think) are causally efficacious, or whether all causation is ultimately reducible to physical causation (e.g. neurons firing, molecules moving, etc.). I argued within a physicalist framework ([physicalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/) is the view that everything that exists either _is_ physical or is grounded in the physical), but argued that on the most plausible definition of causation, our mental states really do cause things and that we lose something central to the concept of causation when we try to reduce everything to physical causation. 

## More about me 
I have practiced yoga and mindfulness since 2011 and completed a British Wheel of Yoga Foundation course in 2013 and a Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for life course in 2019. I am also a qualified English Language teacher. I spent five and half years working at a call centre whilst at University, where I learnt the underrated art of great customer service. I love all things science fiction.
